## Open questions:
- Story Point - what for? (metrics Sprint Burndown, Velocity);
- Story Point vs Hours pros/cons;
- Estimations techniques (story points, T-Shirt approach, Planning Poker, top-bottom, bottom-up, PERT, â€¦.);
- Estimations in un-known position (unknown scope, unknown technology);
- Explanation on what to do when the estimation is failed;
- Take risks into account? estimates multipliers (communication, bug fixing, additional effort on Accessibility, Tests, Cross-browser support, responsive/adaptive design, localization/globalization).
