## Open questions:
- OOP principles, pros/cons:
  - Encapsulation;
  - Abstraction;
  - Inheritance;
  - Polymorphism;
  - Dependency injection.
- Functional programming pros/cons:
  - Pure functions, side effects;
  - Immutability;
  - Functions as first-class entities;
  - Functions composition;
  - High order functions;
  - Recursion;
  - Currying/Partial Application/Memorization.
- Functional Programming vs OOP paradigms, composition over inheritance.
- Reactive programming (eg. RXJS) pros/cons:
  - Streams, merging, writing declarative code, avoiding callback hell, threading and asynchronous mechanisms implementation, purity, etc.;  
  - Disadvantages, only hard debugging, making documentation, memory consumption, time to start, managing concurrency, data immutability required, Complexity of testing, learning curve.
