## Open questions:
- What is Software Architecture?
  - Software elements (modules);
  - Relations among them (connections and communication protocols);
  - Properties of both elements and relations (quality attributes);
  - Constraints
- Steps to define Architecture?
  - Identify Stakeholders (to communicate with);
  - Understand the Problem, Functional Requirements (solve a valid business problem or have a recognizable return on investment (ROI));
  - Identify Design Elements and their Relationships (boundaries and context of the system);
  - Evaluate the Architecture Design (Non-Functional Requirements, quality attributes, constraints);
  - Prioritize quality attributes (trade-off analysis, suffer ones for others);
  - Transform the Architecture Design (quality attributes oriented - optimization of solutions using various patterns);
  - Document the results (to facilitate communication between stakeholders).
- Good Architecture principles?
  - SOLID;
  - Separation of concerns (SoC): separate your application into different sections, and each section will address a separate concern;
  - System Service Components should be business focused. Security, communications, or system services like logging, profiling, and configuration should be abstracted in the separate components;
  - Single Responsibility principle: Every module for a single functionality;
  - Principle of Least Knowledge (Or Law of Demeter): An object should have limited knowledge about other objects;
  - DRY;
  - KISS;
  - Minimize upfront design: Only design what is necessary. YAGNI ("You ainâ€™t gonna need it"). think Return for Investment (ROI);
  - Composition over Inheritance while Reusing the Functionality;
  - Identify Components and Group them in Logical Layers;
  - Define the Communication Protocol, Data Format between Layers;
  - Design Exceptions and Exception Handling Mechanism;
  - Naming Convention.
